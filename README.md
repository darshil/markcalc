# MarkCalc

## About MarkCalc
MarkCalc is a web app that lets teachers post students marks and students can accesss their marks. It started off as a Hackathon project at Electric City Hacks 2016. 

At the hackathon it let students calcuate their marks depending on different weightings. After the hackathon, we looked at the project completley differently and came with a whole new idea.

First we decided to develop it using JS and Firebase but later on decided to try out Angular and VueJS. The team lost focus on this project so currently all development has been halted. This project could be restarted in the future.
